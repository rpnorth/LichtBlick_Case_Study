Assumptions:
- customers with product 2000 were dropped as pricing/prodcut information was not available. As they made up a <8% of the customers, it was assumed that this was more accurate than trying to estimate the price of this product
- the analysis focused on active customers at the time the data was downloaded. This made it possible to provide average revenue at the three different download dates. 
- revenue was calculated over three periods, based on when the pricing info started, and when the data was downloaded.
    - thus contract count, revenue, and revenue per contract could be compared at three different time points
    - the values correspond to active customers at time the data was downloaded
